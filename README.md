# Portfolio-Site
This repository will contain different version of my portfolio website

## Version 1 (6/13/2018):
This version was created as a final project in my web development class.  This website is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance where a cloudwatch event triggers lambda functions to start and stop it in non peak hours.  It uses mysql to put user info into a database, javascript, jquery and ajax.

## Future Changes:
Better database security, use of Angular, React, and Bootsrap, and better organization
